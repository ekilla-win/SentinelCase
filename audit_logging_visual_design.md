# Audit Logging Visual Design Scheme

## 1. Design Philosophy

### Overall Visual Direction

- A 'Digital Fortress' aesthetic, merging forensic precision with robust security. The visual language is inspired by the clean, data-driven interfaces of Palantir and the understated confidence of brands like Polestar. The core idea is to build trust through clarity and sophistication, reflecting the platform's high-trust environment.

### Content Density

- High Density. Each slide will present 3-5 key points, with a content-to-whitespace ratio of approximately 80/20. The design prioritizes clear, structured information delivery, utilizing technical diagrams and detailed lists to convey complex security features.

## 2. Color System

**Primary Colors**

- Background color: #1A1D21 (Deep charcoal, establishing a secure, professional foundation)
- Primary color: #3D6E7C (Teal blue, conveying trust and technical precision)
- Secondary color: #A0AEC0 (Cool gray, for supporting information and subtle hierarchy)
- Accent color: #D69E2E (Amber gold, highlighting critical security elements and warnings)

**Text Colors**

- Dark text (for light backgrounds): #2D3748
- Light text (for dark backgrounds): #E2E8F0

## 3. Font Design

**Heading Fonts**

- English fonts
  - Chiron Hei HK (A modern geometric sans-serif, its sharp lines convey technical precision and authority)
  - Hedvig Letters Sans (A distinctive sans-serif with a unique character, suggesting innovation and modernity)

**Body Fonts**

- English fonts
  - Quattrocento Sans (A classic and highly readable sans-serif, ensuring clarity for dense technical information)

## 4. Image Style

- Abstract and conceptual. Utilize macro photography of architectural materials (brushed metal, concrete) to convey robustness. Graphics should be minimalist data visualizations, network graphs, and subtle geometric patterns, all treated with a desaturated, cool-toned color grade.
